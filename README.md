# Laravel Package Template
This is an opinionated template to quickly scaffold out a Laravel package. This is primarily used for my personal projects but is open for anybody to use.

## Usage
Make sure you swap out the placeholder tokens. You can do a global search and replace.

- `{PackageName}` : This is the package name in PascalCase, example: `MyPackageName`.
- `{package-name}` : This is your package name in kebab-case, example: `my-package-name`.
- `{package_description}` : This is the description of your package.
- `{author_name}` : This is the author of your package.
- `{author_email}` : This is the email address of the author.
    
And ofcourse, edit this `README.md` file for your package's use.
